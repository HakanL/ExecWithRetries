ExecWithRetries

ExecWithRetries for .NET4 (from http://mvolo.com/)


The excellent tool from Mike Volodarsky (http://mvolo.com/configure-iis-websites-windows-azure-startup-tasks-appcmd/execwithretries/) was compiled for .NET 2,
and later OS families at Azure don't have .NET 2 installed so I reverse-engineered his tool and posted the source code here. Hope you don't mind Mike.
